- Practice data structures and control flow.
- Get familiar with functions and error handling.
- Build a solid foundation to tackle bioinformatics problems.

## Contents

- Variables and data types
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions and error handling
- Working with files
- Basic practical exercises

Each `.py` file contains examples and exercises to practice these concepts.
