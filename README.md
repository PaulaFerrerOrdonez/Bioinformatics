# Bioinformatics
In this repository, I am documenting my journey as I work toward building the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to pursue a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics.
My goal is to strengthen my background in programming, data analysis, and computational tools that are widely used in the field of bioinformatics—skills that will complement my existing knowledge in biochemistry.
Through a series of small projects, code exercises, and learning notes, I aim to track my progress and stay accountable,build a personal portfolio that reflects growth and dedication develop the technical foundation needed for graduate-level study
While I’m still learning and far from an expert, this repository is meant to serve as an open notebook—a space to demonstrate consistency, curiosity, and commitment over time.
